	<h1>ABOUT &nbsp; US</h1>
	<center>
		<p>AK Animal Center accepts all animals found or surrendered to us, regardless of age, breed, size or health. We are committed to placing all healthy or medically and behaviorally treatable animals into new homes by implementing proven methods of lifesaving and rehabilitation. We ultimately provide shelter, veterinary care, behavior training, rescue transfer and adoption services for over 3,000 animals in need each year, and further assist our community through lost and found services, whereby we reunite hundreds of lost pets with their families annually. Our collective goal is to end the killing of 100% of savable pets in shelters, reserving euthanasia only for those that are suffering terminally or determined to be a danger to the public.</p>
